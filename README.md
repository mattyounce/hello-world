# hello-world
First Repo for learning mechanics

I am a mathematician, data scientist, developer, enterprise architect, computational linguist, knowledge engineer, teacher and author.
I've developed in many languages including C, C++, Java, Python, R, SAS.

There's so much work to be done to make the world a better place!

My life's passion is to develop and apply mathematics, tools, processes and apps to assist people in reaching their full potential.

One of the best tools is modeling, in the sense of a simplified ontology with semantics and inference capability, to help visualize the possible solutions/goals/decisions compelled in a situation.

We do this by sharing through open source, and I yaern to finally be part of that community!!
Sincerely,
Matthew B. Younce, Ph.D.
